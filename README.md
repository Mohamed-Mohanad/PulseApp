# Hardware

It's a device that is attached to the patient and contains many sensors that read the patient's vital signs and send the readings to the Firebase to be dealt with and presented to the patient on the application, and it also contains a location at any time, We are using the beta version of the development board (nodeMCU-esp8266)

Ingredients used:
-Heart reat sensor (max30100)
